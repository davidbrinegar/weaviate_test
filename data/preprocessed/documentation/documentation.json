        "content": "Looker 21 changelog 21.20 changedTheUse old dashboards routeslegacy featurenow defaults to off. changedAftersaving an Explore to a dashboard, users who click the dashboard link from the confirmation banner will enter the dashboard inedit mode. changedWhen a user attempts to navigate away from a dashboard that has unsaved changes, the user willnow see aDiscard changes?warning dialog. changedA new legacy feature,Use old navigation and legacy routing, allows you to disable enhanced navigation, which is now the default navigation experience. TheUse old navigation and legacy routinglegacy featurewill be removed starting in Looker 22.2. changedThe defaultalertsexperience now includes all the features and capabilities of enhanced alerts without the need to enable aLabs feature. changedIn order to address a vulnerability, Looker no longer recognizes self-closing XHTML tags in custom visualizations. Enabling a new legacy feature,Allow XHTML-style Empty Tags in Custom Visualizations, causes self-closing XHTML tags to be recognized in custom visualizations, but also exposes the vulnerability. For more information, see theAllowing XHTML-style empty tags in custom visualizationsBest Practices page. addedLooker has improvedDark Modevisualization styling forsingle value, Cartesian,pie, anddonut multiplescharts. addedA newdetails panelis available for dashboards, including a new area where you can add a description for the dashboard. Metadata that shows the user who created and updated the dashboard, along with the number of favorites and views, also appears. addedThe newGuided analyses in System ActivityLabs featureprovides the option to leverage a question-and-answer format forperforming analysesin theHistorySystem Activity Explore. addedTheDashboardSystem Activity Explore now includes thepreferred_viewerparameter and also mitigates an issue where theis_legacyfield was not accounting for nulls. addedLooker now supports theapproximateparameter for the Google BigQuery Standard SQL dialect. addedTheLookML New Runtime (Aragonite)Labs toggle enables the option to use Aragonite on the Looker instance. When this Labs feature is enabled (the default), LookML developers can turn on Aragonite for individual LookML projects on the instance by adding thearagonite: yesstatement to a project's manifest file. addedA new error message warns users when they attempt to use Liquid templates in thevalue_formatparameter. addedTheDashboard Detailsdescription in the newDashboard Details paneluses the same API as previous descriptions. addedLooker dialect MySQL 8.0.12+ now supportsincremental PDTs. addedA new endpoint to the Looker SDK lets users request a dependency graph for a PDT. addedLooker has introduced a new LookML parameter,interval_trigger. Theinterval_triggerparameter specifies an interval at which a derived table is triggered for rebuild.interval_triggercan be a subparameter ofdatagrouporderived_table, and it accepts an interval string that indicates a number of seconds, minutes, or hours (such as\"24 hours\"). addedThePDT details modalnow includes aShow Dependency Graphbutton that displays a relationship diagram with the names and statuses of anycascading derived tablesthat the PDT depends on. fixedIn anested menu, the parent menu item now remains highlighted. fixedClicking amenu itemwith a nested menu will not close both menus. fixedAn issue has been fixed where previously LDAP groups that were prefixed with#were causing errors. fixedAn error message in beta users pages that stated\"user never logged in\"for users who had logged in via SAML has been fixed. fixedPerformance issues with the group selector on the user edit pages have been fixed. This required a slight change to the design, but the overall UX is the same. fixedLooker now accepts any valid certificate trust path when verifying SSL/TLS certificates, rather than failing if there is an invalid and valid path in the same chain presented from the server. fixedErroneous dates, such asJanuary 1900, no longer appear in query results when a user downloads results in CSV format. fixedTherun_queryAPI endpoint now renders an empty result set instead of returning an error stating that\"The response body could not be parsed\". fixedUsing the parametervalue_format_namenow rounds to the specified floating point precision. fixedDownloading results in XLSX format no longer renders numbers using exponential notation. fixedAn issue has been fixed that caused certain System Activity queries from theHistoryExplore to return a primary key error. fixedAn issue has been fixed that allowed thesystem_activitymodel to be selected while model sets were being edited. 21.18 changedDeleted Datehas been changed toMoved to Trash Datein the Look and Dashboard usage views of the System Activity Content Usage Explores to differentiate between soft deletion (trash) and hard deletion (absolute). changedTheRevert to Legacy Dashboardslegacy featurehas beenextendeduntil Looker 22.0. changedFor Looker connections toMicrosoft SQL Server (MSSQL),Microsoft Azure Synapse Analytics, andMicrosoft Azure SQL Database, if you need to specify a non-default port other than 1433 and your database requires using a comma instead of a colon, you can adduseCommaHostPortSeparator=truein theAdditional Paramsfield of Looker'sConnection Settingspage. This allows you to specify a non-default port other than 1433 in theRemote Host:Portfield. changedThe border color for theButtoncomponent has been updated to improve contrast. changedThe border color for inputcomponentshas been updated to improve contrast. addedThe following Looker Marketplace Blocks have been converted to a new structure that utilizesLookML refinementsrather thanextendsand are available for instances on Looker 21.8 or later: Retail Analytics, Google Ads Transfer, Jira, Shopify, Amazon Redshift Admin, Hubspot Marketing, Zendesk, Braintree Payments, Community Mobility, Campaign Manager 360, GitHub, Google Analytics 360, Search Ads 360, Chronicle, Google Cloud Audit Logs, Census Data, and BigQuery Info Schema. If your Looker instance has a version of one of these block installed that uses extends and you would like to install the version of the block that uses refinements, you can follow these instructions tomigrate any customizationsyour extends-based block may have. addedLooker now prevents schedules from re-running indefinitely if a schedule job is interrupted. Looker will attempt to re-run the job up to 10 times. addedA new Labs feature,URL Links in Boards, allows editors of boards toadd links to any URLon a board alongside their existing Looks and dashboards. addedUsers can now group alerts by alert owner or dashboard name on theManage Alertsuser pageand theAlertsadmin page. addedLooker instances created with Looker 21.18 and later have thesee_pdtspermission added to theDeveloperdefault permission set. addedThe option toConvert Project to New LookMLhas been re-introduced to the LookML IDE to allow users toconvert their YAML LookML to LookML. addedDremio and Dremio 11+ now support timezone conversions. addedFirebolt now supports in-database pivoting. addedGoogle ripple animation has been added to theIconButton,Checkbox,Radio, andToggleSwitchcomponents. The ripple is not visible when content is embedded. addedWithin a Looker instance,private embedscan now use theGoogle OAuthandOpenID Connectauthentication flows to authenticate a user. fixedA bug has been resolved where incremental PDTs with atimezoneparameter would previousy generate timezone conversion incorrectly in theWHEREclause of an incremental PDT update. fixedA bug has been resolved that previously caused text within a<link>tag in inline documentation to not be formatted with blue text. fixedA bug has been resolved that previously caused the swatch in anInputColorcomponent to be incorrect when the field was disabled. fixedA bug has been resolved for the Labs beta featureLookML Dashboard Organizationthat would cause LookML dashboards to not show up in the LookML dashboards folder if a customer had previously deleted LookML projects that contained LookML folders. 21.16 changedTheEnhanced NavigationLabs feature is now on by default for all customer instances. changedTheCustom FieldsLabs feature has moved from experimental to beta. changedWhen formatting is enabled for query downloads, JSON numeric values must be enclosed in quotes. changedFor PDTs that are persisted asmaterialized viewson your database, thePDT Adminpage displays \"Materialized View\" under the PDT name in the PDT table, and displays \"Materialized View\" as thepersistence rulein the PDT table and thePDT Detailsmodal. changedThe legacy field picker toggle has been removed. changedA non-admin user can now be granted thesee_alertspermission, which enables access to theAlertsmanagement pageand theAlert Historypagein theAdminsection of Looker. From theAlertsmanagement page, they can view, follow, edit, self-assign, or delete any alert on the Looker instance. changedDisplay-name-related attributes for alert owners and followers have been re-added to the public alert API. addedWhen enabled, a new experimental Labs toggle option,LookML Dashboard Organization, lets users organize LookML dashboards into other folders besides the default folder,LookML dashboards. addedTheEnhanced NavigationLabs feature allowsfoldersto be expanded in thenew enhanced left navigation panel. When the feature is enabled, theAdminmenu is now an option in the left navigation panel instead of in the gear menu on the top navigation bar. addedThestepped funnel visualization optionhas been re-introduced in new dashboards. addedNewdashboard settings,ExpandedandCollapsed, now let you choose the default appearance for dashboard filters. addedUsers can now can copy a dashboard from within the dashboard itself using thedashboard's three-dot menu. addedCross-filteringis now available for touchscreen devices. When cross-filtering is enabled for a dashboard, thetouch and holdbehavior will apply the filter. addedAlways Retry Failed PDT Buildsis a new checkbox in Looker'sconnection settings. When theAlways Retry Failed PDT Buildssetting is enabled, theLooker regeneratorwill attempt to rebuildtrigger-persisted tablesthat failed in the previous regenerator cycle, even if a PDT's trigger value has not changed since the previous trigger check.Always Retry Failed PDT Buildsis disabled by default. addedEmbed Userscredentials (for embed roles) andLooker Supportcredentials (for support roles) are now classified and displayed accordingly in theEdit Grouppage. addedLegacy dashboards scheduled for delivery from within a folderwill now use the same interface as new dashboards and alerts. The changes to the folders UI are cosmetic only; functionality is unchanged. fixedThe 12:00:00 PM timestamps now display as expected for XLSX downloads that use the new query streamers. fixedStreamed queries no longer return a totals row if there are no results. fixedSorting the pivot keys oftype:longusing new query streamers now works as expected. fixedUsers can now see better performant filter suggestions when creating a new filter. fixedThe EULA statement is now readable on all instances as expected. fixedTheNever logged inlabel is now added correctly to SAML logins if theNew Users Pageexperimental Labs feature is enabled. fixedConnection tests no longer appear canceled when they contain errors. fixedUsers with custom email domains can now be added as expected using theAdd Userssetting inNew Userspage. 21.14 changedStarting in Looker 21.14, theSyntax Tolerant Liquidlegacy feature flag will be disabled for all users by default. Looker admins can continue to turn this warning off and on until October 2021, when the toggle will be removed. changedTheNew Explore VisualizationsLabs featureis now enabled by default. changedTheLooker API4.0 is now designated asbetarather thanexperimental. changedNative derived tablesthat use thedev_filtersparameter are rebuilt in Development Mode only if a production version that satisfies the query does not exist. changedMemSQL has been rebranded toSingleStore. changedStarting August 13, 2021,GitHub requires token authentication for all Git operations. For all LookML projects that useGitHub with password authentication, to successfully commit you need toreset your Git connection in your project settingsto use a personal access token. changedWhen a user is deleted, any alerts they own are also deleted automatically and immediately. addedEnhanced Alertsis aLabs featurethat, when enabled, displays a new UI on the alert management pages forusersandadmins, allows users to see moredetailsabout an alert, and enables Looker to sync an alert withmost changesmade to the alert's dashboard content. addedTheForecastingLabs feature enables analysts to project analyses into the future without derived tables, table calculations, or custom code. addedClear cache and refresh permissionis an experimental Labs feature that enables theclear_cache_refreshpermission, which controls users' abilities to clear cache and refresh internal and embedded content. addedIntroducingAPI Explorer, our all new interactive API reference documentation that replaces theAPI Docsfeature. Starting in 21.14, API Docs is a legacy feature; however, it can still be accessed with theRequire Authentication to Retrieve API Specificationstoggle. addedUsers can now use theBincustom dimension type to create custom bins, or tiers, on numeric dimensions without the need to write complex LEXP expressions. addedThe LookML dimension typebinhas been introduced as an alias of the typetier. addedUsers can now use theGet linkoptionunder the dashboardActionsmenu to easily share content and copy the correct URL. addedGoogle Cloud Spanneris now a supported Looker dialect and no longer requires a JDBC driver to connect to the Spanner instance. It now supports query time zones, symmetric aggregates, and multipleDISTINCTcolumns in a singleSELECTstatement. addedIn thePDT detailsmodal of thePersistent Derived Tablesadmin page, users can now see the SQL that was used for the last build of a PDT. addedAdmins can now create permission sets for users to include or exclude the ability to clear cache and refresh. By default, Looker users will have this permission enabled. fixedThe first tab of XLSX files that are downloaded with the new query streaming pipeline now showSheet1as their sheet name. fixedUsing any time-related fields in the custom measure filter condition no longer creates unnecessary time zone conversions and works as expected. fixedThesql_quoteLiquid filternow accepts arrays as input. fixedFordocument filesin your Looker project, the IDE preview will now render the files in the same way that the files appear to your users. Before, the IDE preview corrected errors in HTML so that the preview might have looked correct even if the file had HTML errors that would have been visible in the final version. Now, if your document files have errors, the errors will be visible in the IDE preview. fixedFor projects withadvanced deploy mode, theGit buttonin the Looker IDE now showsPull from Primary Branchwhen a development branch is behind the production branch andMerge to Primary Branchwhen there are unmerged commits on the developer branch. 21.12 changedThe error-message format has been enhanced forvalue_format_nameandvalue_formatparameter mismatches. Example:Invalid 'value_format'. Error: 'decimal_1' is invalid for the 'value_format' parameter. Did you mean to use the 'value_format_name' parameter? changedIn the System ActivityUserExplore, theSessionsview now applies a default filter to remove \"ephemeral\" sessions that are used for rendering. This can be overridden, if necessary, by filtering on thesession.credential_typedimension. changedSQL Runner buttons will no longer be surfaced forSystem Activity Explores. changedRequired filtersthat are typepopoveroradvancedwill now showValue requiredinstead ofAny value. changedUsers with thesave_contentpermission now have the ability to add tiles to dashboards. changedTheMake public...keyboard shortcuts Command-Shift-P (Mac) and Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows) have been removed from Explores and Looks. changedFields of typeYesNowill have user-written SQL wrapped in parentheses when the fields are used in a SQL filter. changedTheRender Long TablesLabs setting for visualizations is now enabled by default. Additionally, for tables with more than 20,000 cells,cell visualizationsas well asconditional formattingoptions other thanBackground colorno longer appear in downloads or deliveries when theExpand Tables to Show All Rowsoption is selected. changedTo prevent merge conflicts, the Looker IDE does not present thePull from (production branch)option to developers when the current developer branch has uncommitted changes. addedThe newRedux DevToolsLabs featureenables debugging application state. addedNew Quick Start analyses are now available for theHistoryandDashboardSystem Activity Explores. addedTheRole Listmeasure is now available in theRoleview in the System Activity model. It provides an aggregated list of therole.namefield. addedUsers are now able toadd Looksdirectly to dashboards with theAdd Looks to dashboardslegacy featuretoggle enabled. addedTwo new integrationsare available from the Looker Action Hub: Google Ads Customer Match and Google Analytics Data Import. See theActionspage in theAdminpanel to enable these actions. These actions are available for instances on Looker 7.4 and later. addedAuto Installis a new toggle setting that has been introduced to the Marketplace settings.Auto Installallows for the auto installation of a suite of fundamental Looker-built applications (for example, API Explorer). addedThe Lookerextension frameworkis out of Labs and now generally available under theAdmin > Platformsettings. The extension framework is a development framework that significantly reduces the effort and complexity of building data applications with Looker. addedAdmins now have the ability to move content to the trash in bulk in theUnused Contentpage. addedA new Labs feature,Enhanced Navigation, simplifies user workflows with unified left-hand navigation and more performant routing between common pages and content. addedTheUpgraded Explore Field PickerLabs feature is out of Labs and now generally available. TheLegacy Explore Field Pickeris available as a Legacy feature until Looker 21.16. addedTheCustom FieldsLabs feature introduces newQuick CalculationandGroupfunctionalities. addedA new Labs feature,Improved LookML Generation, adds auto-generated measures and inline comment explanations to new LookML projects that aregenerated from your database. addedThe new Experimental Labs feature,Prerender iframes (before data loads) for custom visualizationshas been added and is disabled by default. addedThe newPDT Development Mode visibilityfeature enables developers to see the state of their Development Mode PDTsin the IDEandon the PDT Admin pagewhile the user is in Development Mode. addedA new LookML parameter,fields_hidden_by_default: yes, allows users to hide all fields in a view from being displayed in an Explore field picker. addedAggregate awareness now recognizes when a dashboard filter is applied to a tile. Whengetting aggregate table LookML from a dashboard, Looker will add the filter's dimension to the tile's aggregate table so the aggregate table can be used for the tile. addedA new LookML parameter,dev_filters, allows a developer to reduce the size of the dataset for a native derived table in Development Mode. fixedSeveral issues with the new query streamer have been addressed, related to aggregations, escaping characters for JSON and Markdown formats, and conditional formatting of numeric fields. fixedThedashboard_element.result_sourcefield no longer contains incorrect conditional logic for merge queries in the System ActivityDashboardExplore. 21.10 changedFor schedules that hadInclude linksdisabled, Looker no longer sends blank emails if the Looker instance is updated to use theSend Link Onlyemailed data policy. Looker will now warn users who attempt to enable theSend Link Onlypolicy that the setting may cause some schedules to not work. changedVisual design improvements to theUpgraded Explore Field PickerLabs featureenable users to more easily differentiate views from groups, and more easily identify when fields are pivoted or filtered. changedTheincremental PDTsfeature is now out of Labs and is generally available. changedIn the System ActivityUserExplore, thehistory.query_run_countmeasure now filters out history records where thehistory.statusvalue iscache_only_miss. changedLooker components 2.0.0 is now available. To reduce the package size of@looker/components, all the date picker and date functions are now in a new package,@looker/components-date. addedThesearch experiencefor theUpgraded Explore Field PickerLabs featurenow includes support forsearch modifiersto narrow the scope of the field list. addedTheLookML Link IDdimension is now available in the System ActivityContent Usage,Dashboard,Dashboard Performance,History,Scheduled Plan, andUserExplores. If a user-defined dashboard was created from a LookML dashboard, this field will contain the ID of the source LookML dashboard. addedA new CLI feature for extension development is now available as thecreate-looker-extension. addedTheCustom Fieldsdimension is now available in the System ActivityDashboard,History,Look,Merge Query, andScheduled PlanExplores. This dimension provides a JSON string of any table calculations, custom measures, or custom dimensions that are used in a query. addedDashboardswill now include more specific error messages on tiles. The error messages will provide context, links to more details, and documentation to help troubleshoot issues. addedUsers can now reset all filters to their default state from thedashboard three-dot menuor by using the Command-Option-R (for Macs) or Ctrl+Alt+R (for Windows)keyboard shortcut. addedNew Looker expression functioncase(when(), when(), else)allows for sequential conditional statements without the need to nest those statements across multipleiffunctions. addedWhengetting aggregate table LookML from a dashboard, Looker determines whether a generated aggregate table could be used for more than one tile and, if so, drops any redundant aggregate tables that can be used for fewer tiles. addedLooker now supports the Firebolt database dialect. addedMaterialized viewscan now be used to create persistent derived tables that leverage your database's persistence functionality. This is available fordatabase dialects that support materialized views. addedThe Looker Marketplace now supports LookML blocksthat are built with refinements syntax. These refinement-style blocks will create a local project that generates arefinements.lkmlfile for adding refinements or additional customizations to the remotely imported CORE project that is managed by Looker. The project also generates a read-only model file that includes therefinements.lkmlfile and all views, Explores, and dashboards from the remote CORE project. addedA new file,marketplace_lock.lkml, maintains metadata about a Marketplace block installation's version number, models, and LookML constant values. fixedYou can now createdata actionswithout defining a form parameter. These actions will show a pending, a success, and an error state. fixedLookschedules that are delivered through webhooknow send a Look title and link back to Looker content, as expected. fixedWhen you're creating a one-time content delivery, the schedule's filter options will default to dashboard filters rather than to the saved schedule plan filter options, as expected. fixedSchedules that contain tables with location dimensions now send as expected. fixedEditing a scheduled plan will now open with the schedule's previously saved state. fixedLookML that was generated for a derived table now escapes underscores in filters, as expected. fixedCustom filters withtype: yesnodimensions now generate correct SQL. fixedThe LookML validator no longer crashes when it encounters an extra closing bracket. fixedTheview_nameparameter that is returned from thelookml_model_exploreAPI endpoint is now the name of the base view that is used for the Explore. Previously, if the Explore name was aliased with either thefromor theview_nameparameter, the endpoint would return the aliased name (which was the same as the Explore name). 21.8 changedThe Looker EULA for trial instances has been updated. changedTheLookML Model ExploreAPI endpoint now returns anoriginal_viewattribute for the fields in the Explore. The attribute value is the original view name where the field was defined. changedThe color contrast in data tables has been increased, which improves the accessibility of data tables inExplores. changedTheClear Cache & Refreshoption forembedded dashboards and tileshas been removed. changedNew query streamers are enabled by default for all non-cached streamable queries. Admin users may opt to use the old streamers by enabling theLegacy Query Streaminglegacy feature. changedOn the System ActivityPerformancedashboard, the history source fordata_download_apihas changed fromapitosystem, and the history source forauthenticated_downloadhas changed fromsystemtoaction_hub. changedLooker dialects that use the MariaDB JDBC driver will default to usingenabledSslProtocolSuites=TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2.The affected dialects are MySQL, MariaDB, Google Cloud MySQL, Amazon Aurora MySQL, Clustrix, MemSQL, and MongoDB Connector for BI. For these dialects, if your database does not support TLS 1.2, your database connection will break unless you explicitly set the following in theAdditional Paramsfield of your connection settings:enabledSslProtocolSuites=TLSv1,TLSv1.1To check if your database's SSL library supports TLS 1.2, you can runSHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE 'tls_version';addedLooker now supports BigQuery BIGNUMERIC columns.addedThe Looker mobile app now supports the same 22 languages that the Looker web app supports.addedAdmins can update settings to enforce user authentication every time a user opens the Looker mobile app. Users will also have the option to set up biometric logins.addedTheSQL Textfield is now available in the System ActivityHistoryExplore.

Consider adding a primary key to '(?)'changedTheDataTableLooker component has been updated to be more accessible for screen readers, with better labeling on columns, rows, and cells.changedTheListcomponent is now enriched with additional features. Additionally, there are two new components for lists:OrderedListandUnorderedList.changedLook and dashboard view counts are now updated asynchronously; therefore, data changes may not be reflected immediately.changedThe LookML IDE renders the following new warning if the dashboard file declaration is invalid:Invalid dashboard declaration. Dashboard must be declared as: <dashboard_name>.changedErrors in a project manifest file will surface correctly even if there are no models in the LookML project.changedAdmins can configureuser attributes referenced by access filtersso that these filters are dropped from theWHEREclause in Looker-generated SQL. The admin can set advanced type user attributes to%,NULL(forString Filter [advanced]) or<0,>=0,NULL(forNumber Filter [advanced]). If the user attributes have these settings, Looker will drop these filters from theWHEREclause. This behavior was previously supported only for LookML projects withaggregate awareness(projects with an aggregate table defined), but is now the behavior for all Looker projects with these user attribute settings.changedThe--scheduler-threads=<i>startup flagcan no longer be used to determine alert runs or to disable alerts. For these tasks, use the--alerts-scheduler-threads=<i>flag.changedThecreate_queryAPI endpoint now accepts filter values of onlytype: string.changedThebigquery_datetime_as_timestamplegacy feature has been removed.

The error message offers a workaround if the SQL is safe.changedBecause of several Slack API endpoint deprecations, users must upgrade toLookerbot version 0.0.16 or higherforLookerbotto function properly.changedThe inline JSON format for actions has been updated to create consistency among action formats. Going forward, the query for the payload data will be returned in theattachmentfield instead of thedatafield, which will now contain any authentication token information.addedThe Looker mobile app is now available for download on the Google Play Store (new iOS version is coming soon). The GA version is v1.1.0 and includes a new and improved dashboard experience. All instances will have mobile access enabled by default. Admins can manage access to the Looker Mobile app from theMobile Application Accesssection of theSettingspage in the LookerAdminpanel.addedWhile inedit modeon dashboards, users now have the ability to discard their changes using theCancelbutton.addedDashboard themes with a dark background color have been significantly improved for embedded customers. Filters now use background and text colors, while filter labels, visualization labels, and icons use text color.addedDashboards that include a tile based on aSystem Activity Explorecan now use the fields from the Explore to create dashboard filters. System Activity filters cannot be added to legacy dashboards.addedThemetadata panelof the Looker IDE, which is enabled by theIDE Metadata SidebarLabs feature, now shows primary key information inview metadata.

This issue has been resolved. fixedThe cronstring parse logic has been modified so that minutes recurrence schedules with one-hour intervals are correctly displayed in the AdminSchedulespanel. Previously, in such one-hour interval minutes recurrence schedules, the end-hour being set was incorrectly using using the default value for the end-hour (6pm). The logic has now been changed so that, for such one-hour intervals, the end-hour = start-hour + 1. fixedLookML fields oftype: dateshould format correctly in downloads. fixedCached Ruby dates should now be parsable by Kotlin XLSX streamers. fixedA previous issue with Support Access settings could cause an unhandled state to lock users out of the instance.

You can evenhide the titleof a tile to take full advanage of the feature. fixedFilters with options will now correctly show the selected values when the options contain special characters like a backslash, caret, or trailing whitespace. fixedIn some cases, inconsistent names were previously used in XLSX downloads. This behavior has been corrected; now  \"sheet1\" is used as the name of the sheet. fixedIn some cases, raw date fields and Boolean values withrun_lookin JSON format were inconsistent. This behavior has been corrected via the new streamers. fixedA change to the schedule modal enables action destinations forms to be displayed for saved schedule plans. fixedCached queries streamed through the new query streamers against Snowflake with theQUOTED_IDENTIFIERS_IGNORE_CASEsetting enabled should now output data as expected. fixedMultiple aggregate fields in a cached streamed query should now be visible in downloads. fixedConditional formatting with font and background colors using three-digit hex codes should now work for XLSX downloads. fixedIn some cases,type: dateLookML fields were formatted incorrectly in downloads.

Looker-hosted customers don't need to take any action. Self-hosted customers will need to update their internal database to a version that supports TLS 1.2+. For MySQL, version 5.6.46+ supports TLS 1.2+. changedFilenames in a LookML project can no longer contain the%character. Existing files that contain%characters will display an error and a tooltip that explains why the files need to be renamed to remove the character. See thenaming conventionsfor more information. changedCustomers on Looker 22.4 need to update their mobile app version to the latest Looker mobile version (v1.2.3) to continue using Looker on iOS mobile devices. changedTheUser Activitydashboardhas been updated to use acompliance_user_permissionstable to ensure that user counts displayed in the dashboard show the latest results from this table. changedTheUser Activitydashboardhas been updated to match contractual verbiage forUser type descriptions(\"Content Creator\" is now \"Standard\"; \"Data-Consumer\" is now \"Viewer\"). changedThe logic ofuser_facts.is_looker_employeehas been adjusted to count only support agents. addedLooker now supports MySQL 8.0 as an internal database.

Self-hosted customers who use MySQL as their internal database may update their internal database version. addedThe LookerAPI 4.0is now generally available. addedThere is now a separate permission for creating and editingcustom fields:create_custom_fields. This permission lets admins control which users can create or edit custom fields, while letting them create and edittable calculationswithcreate_table_calculations. Users who had thecreate_table_calculationspermission on instances with theCustom FieldsLabs feature enabled prior to Looker 22.4 will automatically be granted thecreate_custom_fieldspermission. addedUnencoded%characters in URLs cause some Looker pages, such as Explores, to not load. Previously Looker did not prevent the use of%characters in IDE filenames, and customers were not warned that using these characters in filenames might break certain pages. This change prevents the use of the%character in filenames in the Looker IDE when files are created or renamed; additionally, an error and a tooltip now appear in the IDE file browser when these filenames are present, explaining that these files should be renamed. addedTo address potential Content Security Policy (CSP) violations, there will be a new loading mechanism for the Looker extension framework. With this release, there is a method for developers totest their extensions with the new loaderto fix any potential issues before the new loader goes live. addedPostgreSQL and Amazon Redshift connections now support aCost Estimateoption.

This behavior has been corrected. fixedCustom embed themes applied from a URL are now considered part ofdashboard-nextschedules. fixedCustomers shared scratch schemas across instances where PDT maintenance was being run less frequently than once per week, which was causing one instance to drop all the others' tables because of an inactive registration key. This behavior has been corrected with a dynamically set registration key, whose lifetime is greater than the maximum PDT maintenance interval. fixedUnder certain circumstances, Looker would render dates from Explores and Looks into XLS and CSV incorrectly. This behavior has been corrected. 22.2 changedErrors that occur before any data is streamed will now be injected into XLSX downloads. changedWhen atable chartcolumn is resized, the contents of the header row automatically wrap to multiple lines, if necessary, so the content is clearly readable. This can be configured with the newTruncate Column Namestable chart option. addedA new API endpoint,import_lookml_dashboard, copies a LookML dashboard as a user-defined dashboard and saves it in a folder. addedStarting in Looker 22.2, Looker supports OpenJDK 11, and Looker-hosted deployments will use OpenJDK 11 by default. Customer-hosted deployments canupgrade to OpenJDK 11. addedWhen you add a new tile to a dashboard, any existingdashboard filterswillautomatically be appliedto filterable fields on the tile. addedSnowflake connections now support aCost Estimateoption.

This behavior has been corrected. fixedPreviously,Groupcustom field types that were created ondimension_groupfields could fail to activate necessary joins in SQL. This behavior has been corrected. fixedPreviously, users could not create aGroupcustom field type on existingcustom fields. This behavior has been corrected. fixedAn issue was found where$$ was shown as$onExploretables. This behavior has been corrected. fixedAn issue was found with Aragonite and localized LookML models where labels in downloads showed their raw values rather than their localized values. This behavior has been corrected. fixedAn issue was found with the Aragonite beta feature where invalid field references in asql_distinct_keyin LookML could cause LookML Validator to crash. This behavior has been corrected. fixedAn issue was found where using dimension fill on a field withdatatype: datecould crash the new Aragonite runtime. This behavior has been corrected. fixedAn issue was found where Aragonite caused a 500 error to be returned in the case where a query that contained a custom measure was filtering on a field that no longer existed. This behavior has been corrected. fixedAn issue was found with the new Aragonite runtime where, after a LookML change or restart, some queries on a dashboard might fail to load but would then load on refresh. This behavior has been corrected. fixedAn issue was found where Aragonite would crash on an invalid filter on a measure oftype: list. This behavior has been corrected. fixedAn issue was found with Aragonite where aMediancustom field type could cause a 500 error.

Customers now must use an allowlist to grant specific people access to their instance. changedPrestoSQL and Trino now default toset SSLVerification=NONE(ifVerify SSLis not set) orset SSLVerification=FULL(ifVerify SSLis set). If you set your own value forSSLVerification, that value will be used. changedUpdates tocustom fieldsandtable calculationfield picker menu options include renamingQuick CalculationstoCalculations, renaming theListandCountcustom field types to, respectively,List of unique valuesandCount distinct, and other small changes. changedPopular fields are no longer displayed in thefield picker search bar. Admins can enable a legacy feature,Popular fields in explore search, to restore thePopular Fieldsdrop-down to Explore searches. Thelegacy featurewill be removed starting in Looker 22.20. changedThe following JDBC drivers have been updated: Firebolt (v.1.21), Microsoft SQL Server (v.9.4), Databricks Spark (v.2.6.21.1039), and Amazon Athena (v.2.0.25.1001). changedMax scheduled job age is now configurable withenv var SCHEDULED_JOB_MAX_AGE_DAYS=20. changedA new legacy feature,Allow double click to select text in textarea in Table Visualizations, lets users double-click on table cell values to manually select text.

For cases with heavy dynamic attributes usage, it may be preferable to toggle off held queries entirely. If Looker is started with the command line argument--experimental-features=query-holding-opt-out, queries will not be held. addedA field has been added to let customers add their preferred key exchange algorithm to theSFTP scheduled plandestination. addedUsers can now sort on columns in adrill overlay. fixedUsing theLookML Dashboards Organizationfeature sometimes caused certain dashboard menu options to be unavailable. This behavior has been corrected. fixedConditional formats now work correctly on the new XLSX streamer. fixedIf a dashboard had two tiles that had the same queries/SQL but that were hiding different fields from visualization, two queries with the same SQL were sent to the database instead of just one.
